# The Number Guess Game

"Guess the Number" is a classic puzzle game with the following rules:

Initially, one party selects a four-digit number with no repeating digits, and then the other party begins to guess. After each guess, a hint in the format of "nAmB" is provided.

"nA" indicates that n digits are guessed correctly and are also in the correct positions; "mB" indicates that m digits are guessed correctly but are in the wrong positions.

For instance, if the other party chooses the number 1234 and you guess 1325, you would receive the hint "1A2B".

You need to revise your guess based on these feedbacks until you find the correct number. During actual gameplay, both parties can guess each other's numbers, with the first one to guess the other's number being the winner.

「猜數字」是一款經典的益智遊戲，規則如下：

由一方選擇一個四位不重複的數字，另一方進行猜測，每次猜測後，會得到一個 "nAmB" 形式的提示，"nA" 代表猜中 n 個數字且位置也正確；"mB" 則表示猜中 m 個數字但位置錯誤。

例如，若對方選擇的數字是 1234，你猜了 1325，那你就會得到 "1A2B" 的提示，你需要根據這些反饋修正猜測，直到找出正確數字。

實際進行遊戲時也可以雙方互猜，先猜出對方選的數字者獲勝。
